Using BeautifulSoup, scrape this website:
 
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions"
 
Scrape the "List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions" for the data.  Use the functionality of Beautifulsoup to scrape the data.  

Note that Pandas does have scraping abilities available, however, use the Beautifulsoup functionality for this assignment.  

Scrape the column:  "2017 (% of world)". Store the scraped data in a defaultdict.
